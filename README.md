## Vision
The Industry Partnered Certification project aims to revolutionize the way academic and professional certifications are issued, verified, and managed. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system provides a secure, transparent, and immutable platform where certificates issued by educational institutions can be verified by industry partners, ensuring authenticity and trust in the certification process.

### Contract Overview

1. **Certificates Management:**
   - Certificates are issued by the contract owner and stored with details like student name, course name, issuer, and status.
   - Industry partners can verify the certificates, updating the status accordingly.
   - Certificates can be revoked by the issuer when necessary.

2. **Industry Partners Management:**
   - Industry partners can be added, deactivated, and reactivated by the contract owner.
   - Only active industry partners can verify certificates.

3. **Security:**
   - Access to critical functions like certificate issuance and partner management is restricted to the contract owner.
   - Industry partners can only verify certificates if they are active, ensuring only trusted entities participate in the verification process.

## Future Scope

1. **Multi-Issuer Support:**
   - Extend the system to allow multiple institutions to issue certificates, each with their own set of industry partners.

2. **Advanced Certificate Metadata:**
   - Include additional metadata in certificates, such as grades, course duration, and student ID, to provide a more comprehensive certification.

3. **Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS):**
   - Seamlessly integrate the certification system with existing LMS platforms to automate the issuance and verification process.

4. **Decentralized Identity Verification:**
   - Implement decentralized identity solutions to further enhance the security and integrity of the certification process.

## Getting Started

To interact with the Industry Partnered Certification contract:

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Use Remix IDE or any other Solidity development environment to deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.

2. **Issue Certificates:**
   - As the contract owner, use the `issueCertificate` function to issue new certificates to students.

3. **Verify Certificates:**
   - Industry partners can use the `verifyCertificate` function to verify the authenticity of issued certificates.

4. **Revoke Certificates:**
   - If necessary, the contract owner can revoke certificates using the `revokeCertificate` function.
